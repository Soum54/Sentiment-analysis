# Sentiment analysis for given text
Sentiment analysis is a technique used to assess the emotional tone of a given text, categorizing it as positive, negative, or neutral. It can also provide a sentiment score for each statement. Additionally, you can upload a CSV file containing multiple text entries to obtain sentiment evaluations for each line in the file.
